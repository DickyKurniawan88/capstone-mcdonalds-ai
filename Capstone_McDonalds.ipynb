            "\n",
            "3. **Total Expenses Trend**: Total expenses have increased from $15,000 million in 2021 to $17,000 million in 2024. Although expenses have risen, the rate of increase is lower than revenue and operating income, indicating a healthy margin expansion.\n",

            "- **Moderate Performance in 2022 and 2023**: Despite the overall positive trend, 2022 and 2023 show 'Moderate' performance. This might suggest some challenges or plateaus in growth, possibly due to factors like market saturation, increased competition, or macroeconomic conditions. Nonetheless, the company managed to maintain steady growth during these years.\n",
